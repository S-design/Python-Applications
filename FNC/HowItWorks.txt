Imports:

import os
import re

Two modules are imported. The os module is used to interact with the operating system, and the re module is used to perform regular expression operations.

get_cleaned_filenames function:


def get_cleaned_filenames(directory):
    filenames = os.listdir(directory)
    cleaned_filenames = set([re.sub(r'\d+', '', name) for name in filenames])
    return cleaned_filenames

This function takes a directory as an argument and returns a set of filenames present in that directory after removing all the numbers from them.

os.listdir(directory) gets the list of all files (and directories) in the specified directory.
re.sub(r'\d+', '', name) uses a regular expression to remove all numbers (\d+) from the name.
The result is a set of filenames with numbers removed.
compare_directories function:


def compare_directories(dir1, dir2):
    filenames_dir1 = get_cleaned_filenames(dir1)
    filenames_dir2 = get_cleaned_filenames(dir2)
    common_names = filenames_dir1.intersection(filenames_dir2)
    unique_in_dir1 = filenames_dir1.difference(filenames_dir2)
    unique_in_dir2 = filenames_dir2.difference(filenames_dir1)
    return common_names, unique_in_dir1, unique_in_dir2

This function compares the cleaned filenames in two directories (dir1 and dir2). It returns three sets:

common_names: Filenames (without numbers) that are present in both directories.
unique_in_dir1: Filenames (without numbers) that are only in dir1.
unique_in_dir2: Filenames (without numbers) that are only in dir2.
Main code block:


if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
This block is executed when the script is run directly (not imported). It does the following:

Prompt the user for paths of two directories.
Call compare_directories with the provided paths.
Print the common filenames and unique filenames from both directories (all without numbers).
In summary, this code allows a user to compare two directories in terms of their file names. It specifically ignores numbers in filenames when making this comparison. So, if dir1 has a file named image123.jpg and dir2 has image456.jpg, the program would consider these filenames as being common between the two directories, because after removing the numbers, both become image.jpg.
